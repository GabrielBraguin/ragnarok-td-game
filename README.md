# ragnarok-td-game
A repository for one of my personal project/game named Ragnarok TD

For now, the game comprises of only ONE level, which contains all enemies and allies created. On future updates, I will create more levels which will work as both tutorials, and game progression levels. History will also be added.

This game was created during the "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D" course, by Ben Tristem and Rick Davidson, which I took on 2021. It is loosely based on the Section 7: Glitch Garden of the course.
